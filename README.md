<b>Course Summary</b>

This course is part of the Android Basics Nanodegree by Google.

Learn the basics of Android and Java programming, and take the first step on your journey to becoming an Android developer!

This course is designed for students who are new to programming, and want to learn how to build Android apps. You don’t need any programming experience to take this course. If you’ve been using a smartphone to surf the web and chat with friends, then you’re our perfect target student!

Learning anything new can be tough. We will walk you through the process of making Android apps, but to get the most out of this course, you must bring your enthusiasm for learning, and budget time on your calendar to learn with us.

By the end of the course, you’ll build two simple (but powerful) apps that you can share with your friends. We also hope that you will learn enough through this course to decide how best to continue your journey as an Android app developer, if you're interesting in pursuing such a path.

<b>Why Take This Course?</b>

If you're a consumer of technology, this course will help you to become a creator of technology. You are only limited by your imagination!

Android powers over 80 percent of the world’s smartphones, and represents an incredible opportunity for developers everywhere. The next billion people coming online will interact with the internet for the very first time on a mobile device. Building for Android gives you the best opportunity to reach these users and make an impact -- both in your community, and on the world.

<b>Prerequisites and Requirements</b>

If you are new to programming and don’t know where to start, then this is the course for you!

We will use Android Studio to build our apps, so you should have access to a computer that can run Android Studio in order to follow along (see Android Studio's System Requirements for details). Don’t worry, you do not need to install Android Studio in advance -- we will provide detailed installation instructions as part of the course.

Access to an Android device is helpful, but not at all required.

Now, in case you have some programming experience, parts of this course may be too slow for you — you should feel free to skip those sections.

Finally, the most important prerequisite is a willingness to learn new things, and belief that you can do this!

See the Technology Requirements for using Udacity.
